# this is begining aLICE WAS BEGINNING TO GET VERY TIRED OF SITTING BY HER SISTERON THE BANK, AND OF HAVING NOTHING TO DO: ONCE OR TWICE SHE HADPEEPED INTO THE BOOK HER SISTER WAS READING, BUT IT HAD NOPICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS IN IT, `AND WHAT IS THE USE OF A BOOK,'THOUGHT aLICE `WITHOUT PICTURES OR CONVERSATION?' sO SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN HER OWN MIND (AS WELL AS SHE COULD,FOR THE HOT DAY MADE HER FEEL VERY SLEEPY AND STUPID), WHETHERTHE PLEASURE OF MAKING A DAISY-CHAIN WOULD BE WORTH THE TROUBLEOF GETTING UP AND PICKING THE DAISIES, WHEN SUDDENLY A wHITErABBIT WITH PINK EYES RAN CLOSE BY HER. tHERE WAS NOTHING SO very REMARKABLE IN THAT; NOR DID aLICETHINK IT SO very MUCH OUT OF THE WAY TO HEAR THE rABBIT SAY TOITSELF, `oH DEAR! oH DEAR! i SHALL BE LATE!' (WHEN SHE THOUGHTIT OVER AFTERWARDS, IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVEWONDERED AT THIS, BUT AT THE TIME IT ALL SEEMED QUITE NATURAL);BUT WHEN THE rABBIT ACTUALLY took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, AND LOOKED AT IT, AND THEN HURRIED ON, aLICE STARTED TOHER FEET, FOR IT FLASHED ACROSS HER MIND THAT SHE HAD NEVERBEFORE SEEN A RABBIT WITH EITHER A WAISTCOAT-POCKET, OR A WATCH TOTAKE OUT OF IT, AND BURNING WITH CURIOSITY, SHE RAN ACROSS THEFIELD AFTER IT, AND FORTUNATELY WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT POPDOWN A LARGE RABBIT-HOLE UNDER THE HEDGE. iN ANOTHER MOMENT DOWN WENT aLICE AFTER IT, NEVER ONCECONSIDERING HOW IN THE WORLD SHE WAS TO GET OUT AGAIN. tHE RABBIT-HOLE WENT STRAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FOR SOME WAY,AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN, SO SUDDENLY THAT aLICE HAD NOT AMOMENT TO THINK ABOUT STOPPING HERSELF BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELFFALLING DOWN A VERY DEEP WELL. eITHER THE WELL WAS VERY DEEP, OR SHE FELL VERY SLOWLY, FOR SHEHAD PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND TOWONDER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. fIRST, SHE TRIED TO LOOKDOWN AND MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO, BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TOSEE ANYTHING; THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL, ANDNOTICED THAT THEY WERE FILLED WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOOK-SHELVES;HERE AND THERE SHE SAW MAPS AND PICTURES HUNG UPON PEGS. sHETOOK DOWN A JAR FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS SHE PASSED; IT WASLABELLED `orange marmalade', BUT TO HER GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT ITWAS EMPTY: SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DROP THE JAR FOR FEAR OF KILLINGSOMEBODY, SO MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS AS SHEFELL PAST IT. `wELL!' THOUGHT aLICE TO HERSELF, `AFTER SUCH A FALL AS THIS, iSHALL THINK NOTHING OF TUMBLING DOWN STAIRS! hOW BRAVE THEY'LLALL THINK ME AT HOME! wHY, i WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT,EVEN IF i FELL OFF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE!' (wHICH WAS VERY LIKELYTRUE.) dOWN, DOWN, DOWN. wOULD THE FALL never COME TO AN END! `iWONDER HOW MANY MILES i'VE FALLEN BY THIS TIME?' SHE SAID ALOUD.`i MUST BE GETTING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH. lETME SEE: THAT WOULD BE FOUR THOUSAND MILES DOWN, i THINK--' (FOR,YOU SEE, aLICE HAD LEARNT SEVERAL THINGS OF THIS SORT IN HERLESSONS IN THE SCHOOLROOM, AND THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A very GOODOPPORTUNITY FOR SHOWING OFF HER KNOWLEDGE, AS THERE WAS NO ONE TOLISTEN TO HER, STILL IT WAS GOOD PRACTICE TO SAY IT OVER) `--YES,THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT DISTANCE--BUT THEN i WONDER WHAT lATITUDEOR lONGITUDE i'VE GOT TO?' (aLICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT lATITUDE WAS,OR lONGITUDE EITHER, BUT THOUGHT THEY WERE NICE GRAND WORDS TOSAY.) pRESENTLY SHE BEGAN AGAIN. `i WONDER IF i SHALL FALL RIGHTthrough THE EARTH! hOW FUNNY IT'LL SEEM TO COME OUT AMONG THEPEOPLE THAT WALK WITH THEIR HEADS DOWNWARD! tHE aNTIPATHIES, iTHINK--' (SHE WAS RATHER GLAD THERE was NO ONE LISTENING, THISTIME, AS IT DIDN'T SOUND AT ALL THE RIGHT WORD) `--BUT i SHALLHAVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY IS, YOU KNOW.pLEASE, mA'AM, IS THIS nEW zEALAND OR aUSTRALIA?' (AND SHE TRIEDTO CURTSEY AS SHE SPOKE--FANCY curtseying AS YOU'RE FALLINGTHROUGH THE AIR! dO YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE IT?) `aND WHATAN IGNORANT LITTLE GIRL SHE'LL THINK ME FOR ASKING! nO, IT'LLNEVER DO TO ASK: PERHAPS i SHALL SEE IT WRITTEN UP SOMEWHERE.' dOWN, DOWN, DOWN. tHERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO, SO aLICE SOONBEGAN TALKING AGAIN. `dINAH'LL MISS ME VERY MUCH TO-NIGHT, iSHOULD THINK!' (dINAH WAS THE CAT.) `i HOPE THEY'LL REMEMBERHER SAUCER OF MILK AT TEA-TIME. dINAH MY DEAR! i WISH YOU WEREDOWN HERE WITH ME! tHERE ARE NO MICE IN THE AIR, i'M AFRAID, BUTYOU MIGHT CATCH A BAT, AND THAT'S VERY LIKE A MOUSE, YOU KNOW.bUT DO CATS EAT BATS, i WONDER?' aND HERE aLICE BEGAN TO GETRATHER SLEEPY, AND WENT ON SAYING TO HERSELF, IN A DREAMY SORT OFWAY, `dO CATS EAT BATS? dO CATS EAT BATS?' AND SOMETIMES, `dOBATS EAT CATS?' FOR, YOU SEE, AS SHE COULDN'T ANSWER EITHERQUESTION, IT DIDN'T MUCH MATTER WHICH WAY SHE PUT IT. sHE FELTTHAT SHE WAS DOZING OFF, AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO DREAM THAT SHEWAS WALKING HAND IN HAND WITH dINAH, AND SAYING TO HER VERYEARNESTLY, `nOW, dINAH, TELL ME THE TRUTH: DID YOU EVER EAT ABAT?' WHEN SUDDENLY, THUMP! THUMP! DOWN SHE CAME UPON A HEAP OFSTICKS AND DRY LEAVES, AND THE FALL WAS OVER. aLICE WAS NOT A BIT HURT, AND SHE JUMPED UP ON TO HER FEET IN AMOMENT: SHE LOOKED UP, BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD; BEFORE HERWAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE, AND THE wHITE rABBIT WAS STILL INSIGHT, HURRYING DOWN IT. tHERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST:AWAY WENT aLICE LIKE THE WIND, AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR ITSAY, AS IT TURNED A CORNER, `oH MY EARS AND WHISKERS, HOW LATEIT'S GETTING!' sHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND IT WHEN SHE TURNED THECORNER, BUT THE rABBIT WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN: SHE FOUNDHERSELF IN A LONG, LOW HALL, WHICH WAS LIT UP BY A ROW OF LAMPSHANGING FROM THE ROOF. tHERE WERE DOORS ALL ROUND THE HALL, BUT THEY WERE ALL LOCKED;AND WHEN aLICE HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE SIDE AND UP THEOTHER, TRYING EVERY DOOR, SHE WALKED SADLY DOWN THE MIDDLE,WONDERING HOW SHE WAS EVER TO GET OUT AGAIN. sUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE THREE-LEGGED TABLE, ALL MADE OFSOLID GLASS; THERE WAS NOTHING ON IT EXCEPT A TINY GOLDEN KEY,AND aLICE'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THEDOORS OF THE HALL; BUT, ALAS! EITHER THE LOCKS WERE TOO LARGE, ORTHE KEY WAS TOO SMALL, BUT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD NOT OPEN ANY OFTHEM. hOWEVER, ON THE SECOND TIME ROUND, SHE CAME UPON A LOWCURTAIN SHE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE, AND BEHIND IT WAS A LITTLEDOOR ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES HIGH: SHE TRIED THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEYIN THE LOCK, AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT IT FITTED! aLICE OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT IT LED INTO A SMALLPASSAGE, NOT MUCH LARGER THAN A RAT-HOLE: SHE KNELT DOWN ANDLOOKED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE LOVELIEST GARDEN YOU EVER SAW.hOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THAT DARK HALL, AND WANDER ABOUTAMONG THOSE BEDS OF BRIGHT FLOWERS AND THOSE COOL FOUNTAINS, BUTSHE COULD NOT EVEN GET HER HEAD THOUGH THE DOORWAY; `AND EVEN IFMY HEAD WOULD GO THROUGH,' THOUGHT POOR aLICE, `IT WOULD BE OFVERY LITTLE USE WITHOUT MY SHOULDERS. oH, HOW i WISHi COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE! i THINK i COULD, IF i ONLYKNOW HOW TO BEGIN.' fOR, YOU SEE, SO MANY OUT-OF-THE-WAY THINGSHAD HAPPENED LATELY, THAT aLICE HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT VERY FEWTHINGS INDEED WERE REALLY IMPOSSIBLE. tHERE SEEMED TO BE NO USE IN WAITING BY THE LITTLE DOOR, SO SHEWENT BACK TO THE TABLE, HALF HOPING SHE MIGHT FIND ANOTHER KEY ONIT, OR AT ANY RATE A BOOK OF RULES FOR SHUTTING PEOPLE UP LIKETELESCOPES: THIS TIME SHE FOUND A LITTLE BOTTLE ON IT, (`WHICHCERTAINLY WAS NOT HERE BEFORE,' SAID aLICE,) AND ROUND THE NECKOF THE BOTTLE WAS A PAPER LABEL, WITH THE WORDS `drink me'BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS. iT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY `dRINK ME,' BUT THE WISE LITTLEaLICE WAS NOT GOING TO DO that IN A HURRY. `nO, i'LL LOOKFIRST,' SHE SAID, `AND SEE WHETHER IT'S MARKED "POISON" OR NOT';FOR SHE HAD READ SEVERAL NICE LITTLE HISTORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WHOHAD GOT BURNT, AND EATEN UP BY WILD BEASTS AND OTHER UNPLEASANTTHINGS, ALL BECAUSE THEY would NOT REMEMBER THE SIMPLE RULESTHEIR FRIENDS HAD TAUGHT THEM: SUCH AS, THAT A RED-HOT POKERWILL BURN YOU IF YOU HOLD IT TOO LONG; AND THAT IF YOU CUT YOURFINGER very DEEPLY WITH A KNIFE, IT USUALLY BLEEDS; AND SHE HADNEVER FORGOTTEN THAT, IF YOU DRINK MUCH FROM A BOTTLE MARKED`POISON,' IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU, SOONER ORLATER. hOWEVER, THIS BOTTLE WAS not MARKED `POISON,' SO aLICE VENTUREDTO TASTE IT, AND FINDING IT VERY NICE, (IT HAD, IN FACT, A SORTOF MIXED FLAVOUR OF CHERRY-TART, CUSTARD, PINE-APPLE, ROASTTURKEY, TOFFEE, AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST,) SHE VERY SOON FINISHEDIT OFF. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * `wHAT A CURIOUS FEELING!'

WHENSHE GOT TO THE DOOR, SHE FOUND HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE GOLDENKEY, AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE FOR IT, SHE FOUND SHECOULD NOT POSSIBLY REACH IT: SHE COULD SEE IT QUITE PLAINLYTHROUGH THE GLASS, AND SHE TRIED HER BEST TO CLIMB UP ONE OF THELEGS OF THE TABLE, BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY; AND WHEN SHE HADTIRED HERSELF OUT WITH TRYING, THE POOR LITTLE THING SAT DOWN ANDCRIED. `cOME, THERE'S NO USE IN CRYING LIKE THAT!' SAID aLICE TOHERSELF, RATHER SHARPLY; `i ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE OFF THIS MINUTE!'sHE GENERALLY GAVE HERSELF VERY GOOD ADVICE, (THOUGH SHE VERYSELDOM FOLLOWED IT), AND SOMETIMES SHE SCOLDED HERSELF SOSEVERELY AS TO BRING TEARS INTO HER EYES; AND ONCE SHE REMEMBEREDTRYING TO BOX HER OWN EARS FOR HAVING CHEATED HERSELF IN A GAMEOF CROQUET SHE WAS PLAYING AGAINST HERSELF, FOR THIS CURIOUSCHILD WAS VERY FOND OF PRETENDING TO BE TWO PEOPLE. `bUT IT'S NOUSE NOW,' THOUGHT POOR aLICE, `TO PRETEND TO BE TWO PEOPLE! wHY,THERE'S HARDLY ENOUGH OF ME LEFT TO MAKE one RESPECTABLEPERSON!' sOON HER EYE FELL ON A LITTLE GLASS BOX THAT WAS LYING UNDERTHE TABLE: SHE OPENED IT, AND FOUND IN IT A VERY SMALL CAKE, ONWHICH THE WORDS `eat me' WERE BEAUTIFULLY MARKED IN CURRANTS.`wELL, i'LL EAT IT,' SAID aLICE, `AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW LARGER,i CAN REACH THE KEY; AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW SMALLER, i CAN CREEPUNDER THE DOOR; SO EITHER WAY i'LL GET INTO THE GARDEN, AND iDON'T CARE WHICH HAPPENS!' sHE ATE A LITTLE BIT, AND SAID ANXIOUSLY TO HERSELF, `wHICHWAY? wHICH WAY?', HOLDING HER HAND ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD TOFEEL WHICH WAY IT WAS GROWING, AND SHE WAS QUITE SURPRISED TOFIND THAT SHE REMAINED THE SAME SIZE: TO BE SURE, THIS GENERALLYHAPPENS WHEN ONE EATS CAKE, BUT aLICE HAD GOT SO MUCH INTO THEWAY OF EXPECTING NOTHING BUT OUT-OF-THE-WAY THINGS TO HAPPEN,THAT IT SEEMED QUITE DULL AND STUPID FOR LIFE TO GO ON IN THECOMMON WAY. sO SHE SET TO WORK, AND VERY SOON FINISHED OFF THE CAKE. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * chapter ii tHE pOOL OF tEARS `cURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER!'

THEN THE rABBIT'S VOICE ALONG--`cATCH HIM, YOU BY THEHEDGE!' THEN SILENCE, AND THEN ANOTHER CONFUSION OF VOICES--`hOLDUP HIS HEAD--bRANDY NOW--dON'T CHOKE HIM--hOW WAS IT, OLD FELLOW?wHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? tELL US ALL ABOUT IT!' lAST CAME A LITTLE FEEBLE, SQUEAKING VOICE, (`tHAT'S bILL,'THOUGHT aLICE,) `wELL, i HARDLY KNOW--nO MORE, THANK YE; i'MBETTER NOW--BUT i'M A DEAL TOO FLUSTERED TO TELL YOU--ALL i KNOWIS, SOMETHING COMES AT ME LIKE A jACK-IN-THE-BOX, AND UP i GOESLIKE A SKY-ROCKET!' `sO YOU DID, OLD FELLOW!' SAID THE OTHERS. `wE MUST BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!' SAID THE rABBIT'S VOICE; ANDaLICE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD, `iF YOU DO. i'LL SETdINAH AT YOU!' tHERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY, AND aLICE THOUGHT TOHERSELF, `i WONDER WHAT THEY will DO NEXT! iF THEY HAD ANYSENSE, THEY'D TAKE THE ROOF OFF.' aFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, THEYBEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN, AND aLICE HEARD THE rABBIT SAY, `aBARROWFUL WILL DO, TO BEGIN WITH.' `a BARROWFUL OF what?' THOUGHT aLICE; BUT SHE HAD NOT LONG TODOUBT, FOR THE NEXT MOMENT A SHOWER OF LITTLE PEBBLES CAMERATTLING IN AT THE WINDOW, AND SOME OF THEM HIT HER IN THE FACE.`i'LL PUT A STOP TO THIS,' SHE SAID TO HERSELF, AND SHOUTED OUT,`yOU'D BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN!' WHICH PRODUCED ANOTHER DEADSILENCE. aLICE NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT THE PEBBLES WERE ALLTURNING INTO LITTLE CAKES AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOOR, AND A BRIGHTIDEA CAME INTO HER HEAD. `iF i EAT ONE OF THESE CAKES,' SHETHOUGHT, `IT'S SURE TO MAKE some CHANGE IN MY SIZE; AND AS ITCAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE ME LARGER, IT MUST MAKE ME SMALLER, iSUPPOSE.' sO SHE SWALLOWED ONE OF THE CAKES, AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FINDTHAT SHE BEGAN SHRINKING DIRECTLY. aS SOON AS SHE WAS SMALLENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR, SHE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE, ANDFOUND QUITE A CROWD OF LITTLE ANIMALS AND BIRDS WAITING OUTSIDE.tHE POOR LITTLE lIZARD, bILL, WAS IN THE MIDDLE, BEING HELD UP BYTWO GUINEA-PIGS, WHO WERE GIVING IT SOMETHING OUT OF A BOTTLE.tHEY ALL MADE A RUSH AT aLICE THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED; BUT SHERAN OFF AS HARD AS SHE COULD, AND SOON FOUND HERSELF SAFE IN ATHICK WOOD. `tHE FIRST THING i'VE GOT TO DO,' SAID aLICE TO HERSELF, AS SHEWANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD, `IS TO GROW TO MY RIGHT SIZE AGAIN;AND THE SECOND THING IS TO FIND MY WAY INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN.i THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST PLAN.' iT SOUNDED AN EXCELLENT PLAN, NO DOUBT, AND VERY NEATLY ANDSIMPLY ARRANGED; THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS, THAT SHE HAD NOT THESMALLEST IDEA HOW TO SET ABOUT IT; AND WHILE SHE WAS PEERINGABOUT ANXIOUSLY AMONG THE TREES, A LITTLE SHARP BARK JUST OVERHER HEAD MADE HER LOOK UP IN A GREAT HURRY. aN ENORMOUS PUPPY WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH LARGE ROUNDEYES, AND FEEBLY STRETCHING OUT ONE PAW, TRYING TO TOUCH HER.`pOOR LITTLE THING!' SAID aLICE, IN A COAXING TONE, AND SHE TRIEDHARD TO WHISTLE TO IT; BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED ALL THETIME AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGRY, IN WHICH CASE ITWOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO EAT HER UP IN SPITE OF ALL HER COAXING. hARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID, SHE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OFSTICK, AND HELD IT OUT TO THE PUPPY; WHEREUPON THE PUPPY JUMPEDINTO THE AIR OFF ALL ITS FEET AT ONCE, WITH A YELP OF DELIGHT,AND RUSHED AT THE STICK, AND MADE BELIEVE TO WORRY IT; THEN aLICEDODGED BEHIND A GREAT THISTLE, TO KEEP HERSELF FROM BEING RUNOVER; AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE PUPPYMADE ANOTHER RUSH AT THE STICK, AND TUMBLED HEAD OVER HEELS INITS HURRY TO GET HOLD OF IT; THEN aLICE, THINKING IT WAS VERYLIKE HAVING A GAME OF PLAY WITH A CART-HORSE, AND EXPECTING EVERYMOMENT TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER ITS FEET, RAN ROUND THE THISTLEAGAIN; THEN THE PUPPY BEGAN A SERIES OF SHORT CHARGES AT THESTICK, RUNNING A VERY LITTLE WAY FORWARDS EACH TIME AND A LONGWAY BACK, AND BARKING HOARSELY ALL THE WHILE, TILL AT LAST IT SATDOWN A GOOD WAY OFF, PANTING, WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITSMOUTH, AND ITS GREAT EYES HALF SHUT. tHIS SEEMED TO aLICE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING HER ESCAPE;SO SHE SET OFF AT ONCE, AND RAN TILL SHE WAS QUITE TIRED AND OUTOF BREATH, AND TILL THE PUPPY'S BARK SOUNDED QUITE FAINT IN THEDISTANCE. `aND YET WHAT A DEAR LITTLE PUPPY IT WAS!' SAID aLICE, AS SHELEANT AGAINST A BUTTERCUP TO REST HERSELF, AND FANNED HERSELFWITH ONE OF THE LEAVES: `i SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TRICKSVERY MUCH, IF--IF i'D ONLY BEEN THE RIGHT SIZE TO DO IT! oHDEAR! i'D NEARLY FORGOTTEN THAT i'VE GOT TO GROW UP AGAIN! lETME SEE--HOW is IT TO BE MANAGED? i SUPPOSE i OUGHT TO EAT ORDRINK SOMETHING OR OTHER; BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS, WHAT?' tHE GREAT QUESTION CERTAINLY WAS, WHAT? aLICE LOOKED ALL ROUNDHER AT THE FLOWERS AND THE BLADES OF GRASS, BUT SHE DID NOT SEEANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO EAT OR DRINK UNDERTHE CIRCUMSTANCES. tHERE WAS A LARGE MUSHROOM GROWING NEAR HER,ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS HERSELF; AND WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UNDERIT, AND ON BOTH SIDES OF IT, AND BEHIND IT, IT OCCURRED TO HERTHAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK AND SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TOP OF IT. sHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE, AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OFTHE MUSHROOM, AND HER EYES IMMEDIATELY MET THOSE OF A LARGECATERPILLAR, THAT WAS SITTING ON THE TOP WITH ITS ARMS FOLDED,QUIETLY SMOKING A LONG HOOKAH, AND TAKING NOT THE SMALLEST NOTICEOF HER OR OF ANYTHING ELSE. chapter v aDVICE FROM A cATERPILLAR tHE cATERPILLAR AND aLICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME INSILENCE: AT LAST THE cATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITSMOUTH, AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID, SLEEPY VOICE. `wHO ARE you?' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. tHIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION. aLICEREPLIED, RATHER SHYLY, `i--i HARDLY KNOW, SIR, JUST AT PRESENT--AT LEAST i KNOW WHO i was WHEN i GOT UP THIS MORNING, BUT i THINKi MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN.' `wHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?' SAID THE cATERPILLAR STERNLY.`eXPLAIN YOURSELF!' `i CAN'T EXPLAIN myself, i'M AFRAID, SIR' SAID aLICE, `BECAUSEi'M NOT MYSELF, YOU SEE.' `i DON'T SEE,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `i'M AFRAID i CAN'T PUT IT MORE CLEARLY,' aLICE REPLIED VERYPOLITELY, `FOR i CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH; ANDBEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING.' `iT ISN'T,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `wELL, PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT SO YET,' SAID aLICE; `BUTWHEN YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO A CHRYSALIS--YOU WILL SOME DAY, YOUKNOW--AND THEN AFTER THAT INTO A BUTTERFLY, i SHOULD THINK YOU'LLFEEL IT A LITTLE QUEER, WON'T YOU?' `nOT A BIT,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `wELL, PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT,' SAID aLICE;`ALL i KNOW IS, IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO me.' `yOU!' SAID THE cATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY. `wHO ARE you?' wHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THECONVERSATION. aLICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE cATERPILLAR'SMAKING SUCH very SHORT REMARKS, AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID,VERY GRAVELY, `i THINK, YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO you ARE, FIRST.' `wHY?' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. hERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION; AND AS aLICE COULD NOTTHINK OF ANY GOOD REASON, AND AS THE cATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE INA very UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND, SHE TURNED AWAY. `cOME BACK!' THE cATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER. `i'VE SOMETHINGIMPORTANT TO SAY!' tHIS SOUNDED PROMISING, CERTAINLY: aLICE TURNED AND CAME BACKAGAIN. `kEEP YOUR TEMPER,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `iS THAT ALL?' SAID aLICE, SWALLOWING DOWN HER ANGER AS WELL ASSHE COULD. `nO,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. aLICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL WAIT, AS SHE HAD NOTHING ELSETO DO, AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT MIGHT TELL HER SOMETHING WORTHHEARING. fOR SOME MINUTES IT PUFFED AWAY WITHOUT SPEAKING, BUTAT LAST IT UNFOLDED ITS ARMS, TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTHAGAIN, AND SAID, `sO YOU THINK YOU'RE CHANGED, DO YOU?' `i'M AFRAID i AM, SIR,' SAID aLICE; `i CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS ASi USED--AND i DON'T KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER!' `cAN'T REMEMBER what THINGS?' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `wELL, i'VE TRIED TO SAY "how doth the little busy bee," BUT ITALL CAME DIFFERENT!' aLICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE. `rEPEAT, "you are old, father william,"' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. aLICE FOLDED HER HANDS, AND BEGAN:-- `yOU ARE OLD, fATHER wILLIAM,' THE YOUNG MAN SAID, `aND YOUR HAIR HAS BECOME VERY WHITE; aND YET YOU INCESSANTLY STAND ON YOUR HEAD-- dO YOU THINK, AT YOUR AGE, IT IS RIGHT?' `iN MY YOUTH,' fATHER wILLIAM REPLIED TO HIS SON, `i FEARED IT MIGHT INJURE THE BRAIN; bUT, NOW THAT i'M PERFECTLY SURE i HAVE NONE, wHY, i DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.' `yOU ARE OLD,' SAID THE YOUTH, `AS i MENTIONED BEFORE, aND HAVE GROWN MOST UNCOMMONLY FAT; yET YOU TURNED A BACK-SOMERSAULT IN AT THE DOOR-- pRAY, WHAT IS THE REASON OF THAT?' `iN MY YOUTH,' SAID THE SAGE, AS HE SHOOK HIS GREY LOCKS, `i KEPT ALL MY LIMBS VERY SUPPLE bY THE USE OF THIS OINTMENT--ONE SHILLING THE BOX-- aLLOW ME TO SELL YOU A COUPLE?' `yOU ARE OLD,' SAID THE YOUTH, `AND YOUR JAWS ARE TOO WEAK fOR ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN SUET; yET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE, WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK-- pRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT?' `iN MY YOUTH,' SAID HIS FATHER, `i TOOK TO THE LAW, aND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE; aND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH, WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW, hAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE.' `yOU ARE OLD,' SAID THE YOUTH, `ONE WOULD HARDLY SUPPOSE tHAT YOUR EYE WAS AS STEADY AS EVER; yET YOU BALANCED AN EEL ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE-- wHAT MADE YOU SO AWFULLY CLEVER?' `i HAVE ANSWERED THREE QUESTIONS, AND THAT IS ENOUGH,' sAID HIS FATHER; `DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AIRS! dO YOU THINK i CAN LISTEN ALL DAY TO SUCH STUFF? bE OFF, OR i'LL KICK YOU DOWN STAIRS!' `tHAT IS NOT SAID RIGHT,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `nOT quite RIGHT, i'M AFRAID,' SAID aLICE, TIMIDLY; `SOME OF THEWORDS HAVE GOT ALTERED.' `iT IS WRONG FROM BEGINNING TO END,' SAID THE cATERPILLARDECIDEDLY, AND THERE WAS SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES. tHE cATERPILLAR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK. `wHAT SIZE DO YOU WANT TO BE?' IT ASKED. `oH, i'M NOT PARTICULAR AS TO SIZE,' aLICE HASTILY REPLIED;`ONLY ONE DOESN'T LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN, YOU KNOW.' `i don't KNOW,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. aLICE SAID NOTHING: SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED INHER LIFE BEFORE, AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER. `aRE YOU CONTENT NOW?' SAID THE cATERPILLAR. `wELL, i SHOULD LIKE TO BE A little LARGER, SIR, IF YOUWOULDN'T MIND,' SAID aLICE: `THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHEDHEIGHT TO BE.' `iT IS A VERY GOOD HEIGHT INDEED!' SAID THE cATERPILLARANGRILY, REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AS IT SPOKE (IT WAS EXACTLY THREEINCHES HIGH). `bUT i'M NOT USED TO IT!' PLEADED POOR aLICE IN A PITEOUS TONE.aND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF, `i WISH THE CREATURES WOULDN'T BE SOEASILY OFFENDED!' `yOU'LL GET USED TO IT IN TIME,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR; AND ITPUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN. tHIS TIME aLICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN.iN A MINUTE OR TWO THE cATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITSMOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE, AND SHOOK ITSELF. tHEN IT GOTDOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM, AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS, MERELYREMARKING AS IT WENT, `oNE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER, ANDTHE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER.' `oNE SIDE OF what? tHE OTHER SIDE OF what?' THOUGHT aLICE TOHERSELF. `oF THE MUSHROOM,' SAID THE cATERPILLAR, JUST AS IF SHE HADASKED IT ALOUD; AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. aLICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR AMINUTE, TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT; AND ASIT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND, SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION.hOWEVER, AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEYWOULD GO, AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND. `aND NOW WHICH IS WHICH?'

SAID aLICE. `eXACTLY SO,' SAID THE hATTER: `AS THE THINGS GET USED UP.' `bUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME TO THE BEGINNING AGAIN?' aLICEVENTURED TO ASK. `sUPPOSE WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT,' THE mARCH hARE INTERRUPTED,YAWNING. `i'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS. i VOTE THE YOUNG LADYTELLS US A STORY.' `i'M AFRAID i DON'T KNOW ONE,' SAID aLICE, RATHER ALARMED ATTHE PROPOSAL. `tHEN THE dORMOUSE SHALL!' THEY BOTH CRIED. `wAKE UP,dORMOUSE!' aND THEY PINCHED IT ON BOTH SIDES AT ONCE. tHE dORMOUSE SLOWLY OPENED HIS EYES. `i WASN'T ASLEEP,' HESAID IN A HOARSE, FEEBLE VOICE: `i HEARD EVERY WORD YOU FELLOWSWERE SAYING.' `tELL US A STORY!' SAID THE mARCH hARE. `yES, PLEASE DO!' PLEADED aLICE. `aND BE QUICK ABOUT IT,' ADDED THE hATTER, `OR YOU'LL BE ASLEEPAGAIN BEFORE IT'S DONE.' `oNCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE LITTLE SISTERS,' THEdORMOUSE BEGAN IN A GREAT HURRY; `AND THEIR NAMES WERE eLSIE,lACIE, AND tILLIE; AND THEY LIVED AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL--' `wHAT DID THEY LIVE ON?' SAID aLICE, WHO ALWAYS TOOK A GREATINTEREST IN QUESTIONS OF EATING AND DRINKING. `tHEY LIVED ON TREACLE,' SAID THE dORMOUSE, AFTER THINKING AMINUTE OR TWO. `tHEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT, YOU KNOW,' aLICE GENTLYREMARKED; `THEY'D HAVE BEEN ILL.' `sO THEY WERE,' SAID THE dORMOUSE; `very ILL.' aLICE TRIED TO FANCY TO HERSELF WHAT SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY WAYSOF LIVING WOULD BE LIKE, BUT IT PUZZLED HER TOO MUCH, SO SHE WENTON: `bUT WHY DID THEY LIVE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL?' `tAKE SOME MORE TEA,' THE mARCH hARE SAID TO aLICE, VERYEARNESTLY. `i'VE HAD NOTHING YET,' aLICE REPLIED IN AN OFFENDED TONE, `SOi CAN'T TAKE MORE.' `yOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TAKE less,' SAID THE hATTER: `IT'S VERYEASY TO TAKE more THAN NOTHING.' `nOBODY ASKED your OPINION,' SAID aLICE. `wHO'S MAKING PERSONAL REMARKS NOW?' THE hATTER ASKEDTRIUMPHANTLY. aLICE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS: SO SHE HELPEDHERSELF TO SOME TEA AND BREAD-AND-BUTTER, AND THEN TURNED TO THEdORMOUSE, AND REPEATED HER QUESTION. `wHY DID THEY LIVE AT THEBOTTOM OF A WELL?' tHE dORMOUSE AGAIN TOOK A MINUTE OR TWO TO THINK ABOUT IT, ANDTHEN SAID, `iT WAS A TREACLE-WELL.' `tHERE'S NO SUCH THING!' aLICE WAS BEGINNING VERY ANGRILY, BUTTHE hATTER AND THE mARCH hARE WENT `sH! SH!' AND THE dORMOUSESULKILY REMARKED, `iF YOU CAN'T BE CIVIL, YOU'D BETTER FINISH THESTORY FOR YOURSELF.' `nO, PLEASE GO ON!' aLICE SAID VERY HUMBLY; `i WON'T INTERRUPTAGAIN. i DARE SAY THERE MAY BE one.' `oNE, INDEED!' SAID THE dORMOUSE INDIGNANTLY. hOWEVER, HECONSENTED TO GO ON. `aND SO THESE THREE LITTLE SISTERS--THEYWERE LEARNING TO DRAW, YOU KNOW--' `wHAT DID THEY DRAW?' SAID aLICE, QUITE FORGETTING HER PROMISE. `tREACLE,' SAID THE dORMOUSE, WITHOUT CONSIDERING AT ALL THISTIME. `i WANT A CLEAN CUP,' INTERRUPTED THE hATTER: `LET'S ALL MOVEONE PLACE ON.' hE MOVED ON AS HE SPOKE, AND THE dORMOUSE FOLLOWED HIM: THEmARCH hARE MOVED INTO THE dORMOUSE'S PLACE, AND aLICE RATHERUNWILLINGLY TOOK THE PLACE OF THE mARCH hARE. tHE hATTER WAS THEONLY ONE WHO GOT ANY ADVANTAGE FROM THE CHANGE: AND aLICE WAS AGOOD DEAL WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE, AS THE mARCH hARE HAD JUST UPSETTHE MILK-JUG INTO HIS PLATE. aLICE DID NOT WISH TO OFFEND THE dORMOUSE AGAIN, SO SHE BEGANVERY CAUTIOUSLY: `bUT i DON'T UNDERSTAND. wHERE DID THEY DRAWTHE TREACLE FROM?' `yOU CAN DRAW WATER OUT OF A WATER-WELL,' SAID THE hATTER; `SOi SHOULD THINK YOU COULD DRAW TREACLE OUT OF A TREACLE-WELL--EH,STUPID?' `bUT THEY WERE in THE WELL,' aLICE SAID TO THE dORMOUSE, NOTCHOOSING TO NOTICE THIS LAST REMARK. `oF COURSE THEY WERE', SAID THE dORMOUSE; `--WELL IN.' tHIS ANSWER SO CONFUSED POOR aLICE, THAT SHE LET THE dORMOUSEGO ON FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT INTERRUPTING IT. `tHEY WERE LEARNING TO DRAW,' THE dORMOUSE WENT ON, YAWNING ANDRUBBING ITS EYES, FOR IT WAS GETTING VERY SLEEPY; `AND THEY DREWALL MANNER OF THINGS--EVERYTHING THAT BEGINS WITH AN m--' `wHY WITH AN m?' SAID aLICE. `wHY NOT?' SAID THE mARCH hARE. aLICE WAS SILENT. tHE dORMOUSE HAD CLOSED ITS EYES BY THIS TIME, AND WAS GOINGOFF INTO A DOZE; BUT, ON BEING PINCHED BY THE hATTER, IT WOKE UPAGAIN WITH A LITTLE SHRIEK, AND WENT ON: `--THAT BEGINS WITH ANm, SUCH AS MOUSE-TRAPS, AND THE MOON, AND MEMORY, AND MUCHNESS--YOU KNOW YOU SAY THINGS ARE "MUCH OF A MUCHNESS"--DID YOU EVERSEE SUCH A THING AS A DRAWING OF A MUCHNESS?' `rEALLY, NOW YOU ASK ME,' SAID aLICE, VERY MUCH CONFUSED, `iDON'T THINK--' `tHEN YOU SHOULDN'T TALK,' SAID THE hATTER. tHIS PIECE OF RUDENESS WAS MORE THAN aLICE COULD BEAR: SHE GOTUP IN GREAT DISGUST, AND WALKED OFF; THE dORMOUSE FELL ASLEEPINSTANTLY, AND NEITHER OF THE OTHERS TOOK THE LEAST NOTICE OF HERGOING, THOUGH SHE LOOKED BACK ONCE OR TWICE, HALF HOPING THATTHEY WOULD CALL AFTER HER: THE LAST TIME SHE SAW THEM, THEY WERETRYING TO PUT THE dORMOUSE INTO THE TEAPOT. `aT ANY RATE i'LL NEVER GO there AGAIN!' SAID aLICE AS SHEPICKED HER WAY THROUGH THE WOOD. `iT'S THE STUPIDEST TEA-PARTY iEVER WAS AT IN ALL MY LIFE!' jUST AS SHE SAID THIS, SHE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE TREES HAD ADOOR LEADING RIGHT INTO IT. `tHAT'S VERY CURIOUS!' SHE THOUGHT.`bUT EVERYTHING'S CURIOUS TODAY. i THINK i MAY AS WELL GO IN ATONCE.' aND IN SHE WENT. oNCE MORE SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE LONG HALL, AND CLOSE TO THELITTLE GLASS TABLE. `nOW, i'LL MANAGE BETTER THIS TIME,' SHESAID TO HERSELF, AND BEGAN BY TAKING THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY, ANDUNLOCKING THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE GARDEN. tHEN SHE WENT TOWORK NIBBLING AT THE MUSHROOM (SHE HAD KEPT A PIECE OF IT IN HERPOCKED) TILL SHE WAS ABOUT A FOOT HIGH: THEN SHE WALKED DOWN THELITTLE PASSAGE: AND then--SHE FOUND HERSELF AT LAST IN THEBEAUTIFUL GARDEN, AMONG THE BRIGHT FLOWER-BEDS AND THE COOLFOUNTAINS. chapter viii tHE qUEEN'S cROQUET-gROUND a LARGE ROSE-TREE STOOD NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN: THEROSES GROWING ON IT WERE WHITE, BUT THERE WERE THREE GARDENERS ATIT, BUSILY PAINTING THEM RED. aLICE THOUGHT THIS A VERY CURIOUSTHING, AND SHE WENT NEARER TO WATCH THEM, AND JUST AS SHE CAME UPTO THEM SHE HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY, `lOOK OUT NOW, fIVE! dON'T GOSPLASHING PAINT OVER ME LIKE THAT!' `i COULDN'T HELP IT,' SAID fIVE, IN A SULKY TONE; `sEVEN JOGGEDMY ELBOW.' oN WHICH sEVEN LOOKED UP AND SAID, `tHAT'S RIGHT, fIVE! aLWAYSLAY THE BLAME ON OTHERS!' `you'd BETTER NOT TALK!' SAID fIVE. `i HEARD THE qUEEN SAY ONLYYESTERDAY YOU DESERVED TO BE BEHEADED!' `wHAT FOR?' SAID THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST. `tHAT'S NONE OF your BUSINESS, tWO!' SAID sEVEN. `yES, IT is HIS BUSINESS!' SAID fIVE, `AND i'LL TELL HIM--ITWAS FOR BRINGING THE COOK TULIP-ROOTS INSTEAD OF ONIONS.' sEVEN FLUNG DOWN HIS BRUSH, AND HAD JUST BEGUN `wELL, OF ALLTHE UNJUST THINGS--' WHEN HIS EYE CHANCED TO FALL UPON aLICE, ASSHE STOOD WATCHING THEM, AND HE CHECKED HIMSELF SUDDENLY: THEOTHERS LOOKED ROUND ALSO, AND ALL OF THEM BOWED LOW. `wOULD YOU TELL ME,' SAID aLICE, A LITTLE TIMIDLY, `WHY YOU AREPAINTING THOSE ROSES?' fIVE AND sEVEN SAID NOTHING, BUT LOOKED AT tWO. tWO BEGAN IN ALOW VOICE, `wHY THE FACT IS, YOU SEE, mISS, THIS HERE OUGHT TOHAVE BEEN A red ROSE-TREE, AND WE PUT A WHITE ONE IN BY MISTAKE;AND IF THE qUEEN WAS TO FIND IT OUT, WE SHOULD ALL HAVE OUR HEADSCUT OFF, YOU KNOW. sO YOU SEE, mISS, WE'RE DOING OUR BEST, AFORESHE COMES, TO--' aT THIS MOMENT fIVE, WHO HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLYLOOKING ACROSS THE GARDEN, CALLED OUT `tHE qUEEN! tHE qUEEN!'AND THE THREE GARDENERS INSTANTLY THREW THEMSELVES FLAT UPONTHEIR FACES. tHERE WAS A SOUND OF MANY FOOTSTEPS, AND aLICELOOKED ROUND, EAGER TO SEE THE qUEEN. fIRST CAME TEN SOLDIERS CARRYING CLUBS; THESE WERE ALL SHAPEDLIKE THE THREE GARDENERS, OBLONG AND FLAT, WITH THEIR HANDS ANDFEET AT THE CORNERS: NEXT THE TEN COURTIERS; THESE WEREORNAMENTED ALL OVER WITH DIAMONDS, AND WALKED TWO AND TWO, AS THESOLDIERS DID. aFTER THESE CAME THE ROYAL CHILDREN; THERE WERETEN OF THEM, AND THE LITTLE DEARS CAME JUMPING MERRILY ALONG HANDIN HAND, IN COUPLES: THEY WERE ALL ORNAMENTED WITH HEARTS. nEXTCAME THE GUESTS, MOSTLY kINGS AND qUEENS, AND AMONG THEM aLICERECOGNISED THE wHITE rABBIT: IT WAS TALKING IN A HURRIED NERVOUSMANNER, SMILING AT EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID, AND WENT BY WITHOUTNOTICING HER. tHEN FOLLOWED THE kNAVE OF hEARTS, CARRYING THEkING'S CROWN ON A CRIMSON VELVET CUSHION; AND, LAST OF ALL THISGRAND PROCESSION, CAME the king and queen of hearts. aLICE WAS RATHER DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIE DOWN ONHER FACE LIKE THE THREE GARDENERS, BUT SHE COULD NOT REMEMBEREVERY HAVING HEARD OF SUCH A RULE AT PROCESSIONS; `AND BESIDES,WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF A PROCESSION,' THOUGHT SHE, `IF PEOPLEHAD ALL TO LIE DOWN UPON THEIR FACES, SO THAT THEY COULDN'T SEEIT?' sO SHE STOOD STILL WHERE SHE WAS, AND WAITED. wHEN THE PROCESSION CAME OPPOSITE TO aLICE, THEY ALL STOPPEDAND LOOKED AT HER, AND THE qUEEN SAID SEVERELY `wHO IS THIS?'sHE SAID IT TO THE kNAVE OF hEARTS, WHO ONLY BOWED AND SMILED INREPLY. `iDIOT!' SAID THE qUEEN, TOSSING HER HEAD IMPATIENTLY; AND,TURNING TO aLICE, SHE WENT ON, `wHAT'S YOUR NAME, CHILD?' `mY NAME IS aLICE, SO PLEASE YOUR mAJESTY,' SAID aLICE VERYPOLITELY; BUT SHE ADDED, TO HERSELF, `wHY, THEY'RE ONLY A PACK OFCARDS, AFTER ALL. i NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF THEM!' `aND WHO ARE these?' SAID THE qUEEN, POINTING TO THE THREEGARDENERS WHO WERE LYING ROUND THE ROSETREE; FOR, YOU SEE, ASTHEY WERE LYING ON THEIR FACES, AND THE PATTERN ON THEIR BACKSWAS THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE PACK, SHE COULD NOT TELL WHETHERTHEY WERE GARDENERS, OR SOLDIERS, OR COURTIERS, OR THREE OF HEROWN CHILDREN. `hOW SHOULD i KNOW?' SAID aLICE, SURPRISED AT HER OWN COURAGE.`iT'S NO BUSINESS OF mine.' tHE qUEEN TURNED CRIMSON WITH FURY, AND, AFTER GLARING AT HERFOR A MOMENT LIKE A WILD BEAST, SCREAMED `oFF WITH HER HEAD!oFF--' `nONSENSE!' SAID aLICE, VERY LOUDLY AND DECIDEDLY, AND THEqUEEN WAS SILENT. tHE kING LAID HIS HAND UPON HER ARM, AND TIMIDLY SAID`cONSIDER, MY DEAR: SHE IS ONLY A CHILD!' tHE qUEEN TURNED ANGRILY AWAY FROM HIM, AND SAID TO THE kNAVE`tURN THEM OVER!' tHE kNAVE DID SO, VERY CAREFULLY, WITH ONE FOOT. `gET UP!' SAID THE qUEEN, IN A SHRILL, LOUD VOICE, AND THETHREE GARDENERS INSTANTLY JUMPED UP, AND BEGAN BOWING TO THEkING, THE qUEEN, THE ROYAL CHILDREN, AND EVERYBODY ELSE. `lEAVE OFF THAT!' SCREAMED THE qUEEN. `yOU MAKE ME GIDDY.'aND THEN, TURNING TO THE ROSE-TREE, SHE WENT ON, `wHAT have YOUBEEN DOING HERE?' `mAY IT PLEASE YOUR mAJESTY,' SAID tWO, IN A VERY HUMBLE TONE,GOING DOWN ON ONE KNEE AS HE SPOKE, `WE WERE TRYING--' `i SEE!' SAID THE qUEEN, WHO HAD MEANWHILE BEEN EXAMINING THEROSES. `oFF WITH THEIR HEADS!' AND THE PROCESSION MOVED ON,THREE OF THE SOLDIERS REMAINING BEHIND TO EXECUTE THE UNFORTUNATEGARDENERS, WHO RAN TO aLICE FOR PROTECTION. `yOU SHAN'T BE BEHEADED!' SAID aLICE, AND SHE PUT THEM INTO ALARGE FLOWER-POT THAT STOOD NEAR. tHE THREE SOLDIERS WANDEREDABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO, LOOKING FOR THEM, AND THEN QUIETLYMARCHED OFF AFTER THE OTHERS. `aRE THEIR HEADS OFF?' SHOUTED THE qUEEN. `tHEIR HEADS ARE GONE, IF IT PLEASE YOUR mAJESTY!' THE SOLDIERSSHOUTED IN REPLY. `tHAT'S RIGHT!' SHOUTED THE qUEEN. `cAN YOU PLAY CROQUET?' tHE SOLDIERS WERE SILENT, AND LOOKED AT aLICE, AS THE QUESTIONWAS EVIDENTLY MEANT FOR HER. `yES!' SHOUTED aLICE. `cOME ON, THEN!' ROARED THE qUEEN, AND aLICE JOINED THEPROCESSION, WONDERING VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. `iT'S--IT'S A VERY FINE DAY!' SAID A TIMID VOICE AT HER SIDE.sHE WAS WALKING BY THE wHITE rABBIT, WHO WAS PEEPING ANXIOUSLYINTO HER FACE. `vERY,' SAID aLICE: `--WHERE'S THE dUCHESS?' `hUSH! hUSH!' SAID THE rABBIT IN A LOW, HURRIED TONE. hELOOKED ANXIOUSLY OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE SPOKE, AND THEN RAISEDHIMSELF UPON TIPTOE, PUT HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO HER EAR, ANDWHISPERED `sHE'S UNDER SENTENCE OF EXECUTION.' `wHAT FOR?' SAID aLICE. `dID YOU SAY "wHAT A PITY!"?' THE rABBIT ASKED. `nO, i DIDN'T,' SAID aLICE: `i DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL A PITY.i SAID "wHAT FOR?"' `sHE BOXED THE qUEEN'S EARS--' THE rABBIT BEGAN. aLICE GAVE ALITTLE SCREAM OF LAUGHTER. `oH, HUSH!' THE rABBIT WHISPERED IN AFRIGHTENED TONE. `tHE qUEEN WILL HEAR YOU! yOU SEE, SHE CAMERATHER LATE, AND THE qUEEN SAID--' `gET TO YOUR PLACES!' SHOUTED THE qUEEN IN A VOICE OF THUNDER,AND PEOPLE BEGAN RUNNING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS, TUMBLING UPAGAINST EACH OTHER; HOWEVER, THEY GOT SETTLED DOWN IN A MINUTE ORTWO, AND THE GAME BEGAN. aLICE THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH ACURIOUS CROQUET-GROUND IN HER LIFE; IT WAS ALL RIDGES ANDFURROWS; THE BALLS WERE LIVE HEDGEHOGS, THE MALLETS LIVEFLAMINGOES, AND THE SOLDIERS HAD TO DOUBLE THEMSELVES UP AND TOSTAND ON THEIR HANDS AND FEET, TO MAKE THE ARCHES. tHE CHIEF DIFFICULTY aLICE FOUND AT FIRST WAS IN MANAGING HERFLAMINGO: SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ITS BODY TUCKED AWAY,COMFORTABLY ENOUGH, UNDER HER ARM, WITH ITS LEGS HANGING DOWN,BUT GENERALLY, JUST AS SHE HAD GOT ITS NECK NICELY STRAIGHTENEDOUT, AND WAS GOING TO GIVE THE HEDGEHOG A BLOW WITH ITS HEAD, ITwould TWIST ITSELF ROUND AND LOOK UP IN HER FACE, WITH SUCH APUZZLED EXPRESSION THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BURSTING OUT LAUGHING:AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT ITS HEAD DOWN, AND WAS GOING TO BEGIN AGAIN,IT WAS VERY PROVOKING TO FIND THAT THE HEDGEHOG HAD UNROLLEDITSELF, AND WAS IN THE ACT OF CRAWLING AWAY: BESIDES ALL THIS,THERE WAS GENERALLY A RIDGE OR FURROW IN THE WAY WHEREVER SHEWANTED TO SEND THE HEDGEHOG TO, AND, AS THE DOUBLED-UP SOLDIERSWERE ALWAYS GETTING UP AND WALKING OFF TO OTHER PARTS OF THEGROUND, aLICE SOON CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A VERYDIFFICULT GAME INDEED. tHE PLAYERS ALL PLAYED AT ONCE WITHOUT WAITING FOR TURNS,QUARRELLING ALL THE WHILE, AND FIGHTING FOR THE HEDGEHOGS; AND INA VERY SHORT TIME THE qUEEN WAS IN A FURIOUS PASSION, AND WENTSTAMPING ABOUT, AND SHOUTING `oFF WITH HIS HEAD!' OR `oFF WITHHER HEAD!' ABOUT ONCE IN A MINUTE. aLICE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY: TO BE SURE, SHE HAD NOT ASYET HAD ANY DISPUTE WITH THE qUEEN, BUT SHE KNEW THAT IT MIGHTHAPPEN ANY MINUTE, `AND THEN,' THOUGHT SHE, `WHAT WOULD BECOME OFME? tHEY'RE DREADFULLY FOND OF BEHEADING PEOPLE HERE; THE GREATWONDER IS, THAT THERE'S ANY ONE LEFT ALIVE!' sHE WAS LOOKING ABOUT FOR SOME WAY OF ESCAPE, AND WONDERINGWHETHER SHE COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT BEING SEEN, WHEN SHE NOTICED ACURIOUS APPEARANCE IN THE AIR: IT PUZZLED HER VERY MUCH ATFIRST, BUT, AFTER WATCHING IT A MINUTE OR TWO, SHE MADE IT OUT TOBE A GRIN, AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF `iT'S THE cHESHIRE cAT: NOW iSHALL HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.' `hOW ARE YOU GETTING ON?' SAID THE cAT, AS SOON AS THERE WASMOUTH ENOUGH FOR IT TO SPEAK WITH. aLICE WAITED TILL THE EYES APPEARED, AND THEN NODDED. `iT'S NOUSE SPEAKING TO IT,' SHE THOUGHT, `TILL ITS EARS HAVE COME, OR ATLEAST ONE OF THEM.' iN ANOTHER MINUTE THE WHOLE HEAD APPEARED,AND THEN aLICE PUT DOWN HER FLAMINGO, AND BEGAN AN ACCOUNT OF THEGAME, FEELING VERY GLAD SHE HAD SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HER. tHEcAT SEEMED TO THINK THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH OF IT NOW IN SIGHT, ANDNO MORE OF IT APPEARED. `i DON'T THINK THEY PLAY AT ALL FAIRLY,' aLICE BEGAN, IN RATHERA COMPLAINING TONE, `AND THEY ALL QUARREL SO DREADFULLY ONE CAN'THEAR ONESELF SPEAK--AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY RULES INPARTICULAR; AT LEAST, IF THERE ARE, NOBODY ATTENDS TO THEM--ANDYOU'VE NO IDEA HOW CONFUSING IT IS ALL THE THINGS BEING ALIVE;FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S THE ARCH i'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH NEXTWALKING ABOUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND--AND i SHOULD HAVECROQUETED THE qUEEN'S HEDGEHOG JUST NOW, ONLY IT RAN AWAY WHEN ITSAW MINE COMING!' `hOW DO YOU LIKE THE qUEEN?' SAID THE cAT IN A LOW VOICE. `nOT AT ALL,' SAID aLICE: `SHE'S SO EXTREMELY--' jUST THENSHE NOTICED THAT THE qUEEN WAS CLOSE BEHIND HER, LISTENING: SOSHE WENT ON, `--LIKELY TO WIN, THAT IT'S HARDLY WORTH WHILEFINISHING THE GAME.' tHE qUEEN SMILED AND PASSED ON. `wHO are YOU TALKING TO?' SAID THE kING, GOING UP TO aLICE, ANDLOOKING AT THE cAT'S HEAD WITH GREAT CURIOSITY. `iT'S A FRIEND OF MINE--A cHESHIRE cAT,' SAID aLICE: `ALLOW METO INTRODUCE IT.' `i DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT AT ALL,' SAID THE kING: `HOWEVER,IT MAY KISS MY HAND IF IT LIKES.' `i'D RATHER NOT,' THE cAT REMARKED. `dON'T BE IMPERTINENT,' SAID THE kING, `AND DON'T LOOK AT MELIKE THAT!' hE GOT BEHIND aLICE AS HE SPOKE. `a CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING,' SAID aLICE. `i'VE READ THAT INSOME BOOK, BUT i DON'T REMEMBER WHERE.' `wELL, IT MUST BE REMOVED,' SAID THE kING VERY DECIDEDLY, ANDHE CALLED THE qUEEN, WHO WAS PASSING AT THE MOMENT, `mY DEAR! iWISH YOU WOULD HAVE THIS CAT REMOVED!' tHE qUEEN HAD ONLY ONE WAY OF SETTLING ALL DIFFICULTIES, GREATOR SMALL. `oFF WITH HIS HEAD!' SHE SAID, WITHOUT EVEN LOOKINGROUND. `i'LL FETCH THE EXECUTIONER MYSELF,' SAID THE kING EAGERLY, ANDHE HURRIED OFF. aLICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK, AND SEE HOW THE GAMEWAS GOING ON, AS SHE HEARD THE qUEEN'S VOICE IN THE DISTANCE,SCREAMING WITH PASSION. sHE HAD ALREADY HEARD HER SENTENCE THREEOF THE PLAYERS TO BE EXECUTED FOR HAVING MISSED THEIR TURNS, ANDSHE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS AT ALL, AS THE GAME WAS INSUCH CONFUSION THAT SHE NEVER KNEW WHETHER IT WAS HER TURN ORNOT. sO SHE WENT IN SEARCH OF HER HEDGEHOG. tHE HEDGEHOG WAS ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH ANOTHER HEDGEHOG,WHICH SEEMED TO aLICE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR CROQUETING ONEOF THEM WITH THE OTHER: THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS, THAT HERFLAMINGO WAS GONE ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDEN, WHEREaLICE COULD SEE IT TRYING IN A HELPLESS SORT OF WAY TO FLY UPINTO A TREE. bY THE TIME SHE HAD CAUGHT THE FLAMINGO AND BROUGHT IT BACK,THE FIGHT WAS OVER, AND BOTH THE HEDGEHOGS WERE OUT OF SIGHT:`BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH,' THOUGHT aLICE, `AS ALL THE ARCHESARE GONE FROM THIS SIDE OF THE GROUND.' sO SHE TUCKED IT AWAYUNDER HER ARM, THAT IT MIGHT NOT ESCAPE AGAIN, AND WENT BACK FORA LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION WITH HER FRIEND. wHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE cHESHIRE cAT, SHE WAS SURPRISED TOFIND QUITE A LARGE CROWD COLLECTED ROUND IT: THERE WAS A DISPUTEGOING ON BETWEEN THE EXECUTIONER, THE kING, AND THE qUEEN, WHOWERE ALL TALKING AT ONCE, WHILE ALL THE REST WERE QUITE SILENT,AND LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. tHE MOMENT aLICE APPEARED, SHE WAS APPEALED TO BY ALL THREE TOSETTLE THE QUESTION, AND THEY REPEATED THEIR ARGUMENTS TO HER,THOUGH, AS THEY ALL SPOKE AT ONCE, SHE FOUND IT VERY HARD INDEEDTO MAKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID. tHE EXECUTIONER'S ARGUMENT WAS, THAT YOU COULDN'T CUT OFF AHEAD UNLESS THERE WAS A BODY TO CUT IT OFF FROM: THAT HE HADNEVER HAD TO DO SUCH A THING BEFORE, AND HE WASN'T GOING TO BEGINAT his TIME OF LIFE. tHE kING'S ARGUMENT WAS, THAT ANYTHING THAT HAD A HEAD COULD BEBEHEADED, AND THAT YOU WEREN'T TO TALK NONSENSE. tHE qUEEN'S ARGUMENT WAS, THAT IF SOMETHING WASN'T DONE ABOUTIT IN LESS THAN NO TIME SHE'D HAVE EVERYBODY EXECUTED, ALL ROUND.(iT WAS THIS LAST REMARK THAT HAD MADE THE WHOLE PARTY LOOK SOGRAVE AND ANXIOUS.) aLICE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO SAY BUT `iT BELONGS TO THEdUCHESS: YOU'D BETTER ASK her ABOUT IT.' `sHE'S IN PRISON,' THE qUEEN SAID TO THE EXECUTIONER: `FETCHHER HERE.' aND THE EXECUTIONER WENT OFF LIKE AN ARROW. tHE cAT'S HEAD BEGAN FADING AWAY THE MOMENT HE WAS GONE, AND,BY THE TIME HE HAD COME BACK WITH THE dUTCHESS, IT HAD ENTIRELYDISAPPEARED; SO THE kING AND THE EXECUTIONER RAN WILDLY UP ANDDOWN LOOKING FOR IT, WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY WENT BACK TO THE GAME. chapter ix tHE mOCK tURTLE'S sTORY `yOU CAN'T THINK HOW GLAD i AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN, YOU DEAR OLDTHING!' SAID THE dUCHESS, AS SHE TUCKED HER ARM AFFECTIONATELYINTO aLICE'S, AND THEY WALKED OFF TOGETHER. aLICE WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND HER IN SUCH A PLEASANT TEMPER, ANDTHOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THE PEPPER THAT HADMADE HER SO SAVAGE WHEN THEY MET IN THE KITCHEN. `wHEN i'm A dUCHESS,' SHE SAID TO HERSELF, (NOT IN A VERYHOPEFUL TONE THOUGH), `i WON'T HAVE ANY PEPPER IN MY KITCHEN atall. sOUP DOES VERY WELL WITHOUT--mAYBE IT'S ALWAYS PEPPER THATMAKES PEOPLE HOT-TEMPERED,' SHE WENT ON, VERY MUCH PLEASED ATHAVING FOUND OUT A NEW KIND OF RULE, `AND VINEGAR THAT MAKES THEMSOUR--AND CAMOMILE THAT MAKES THEM BITTER--AND--AND BARLEY-SUGARAND SUCH THINGS THAT MAKE CHILDREN SWEET-TEMPERED. i ONLY WISHPEOPLE KNEW THAT: THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE SO STINGY ABOUT IT, YOUKNOW--' sHE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE dUCHESS BY THIS TIME, AND WAS ALITTLE STARTLED WHEN SHE HEARD HER VOICE CLOSE TO HER EAR.`yOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING, MY DEAR, AND THAT MAKES YOUFORGET TO TALK. i CAN'T TELL YOU JUST NOW WHAT THE MORAL OF THATIS, BUT i SHALL REMEMBER IT IN A BIT.' `pERHAPS IT HASN'T ONE,' aLICE VENTURED TO REMARK. `tUT, TUT, CHILD!' SAID THE dUCHESS. `eVERYTHING'S GOT AMORAL, IF ONLY YOU CAN FIND IT.' aND SHE SQUEEZED HERSELF UPCLOSER TO aLICE'S SIDE AS SHE SPOKE. aLICE DID NOT MUCH LIKE KEEPING SO CLOSE TO HER: FIRST,BECAUSE THE dUCHESS WAS very UGLY; AND SECONDLY, BECAUSE SHE WASEXACTLY THE RIGHT HEIGHT TO REST HER CHIN UPON aLICE'S SHOULDER,AND IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLY SHARP CHIN. hOWEVER, SHE DID NOTLIKE TO BE RUDE, SO SHE BORE IT AS WELL AS SHE COULD. `tHE GAME'S GOING ON RATHER BETTER NOW,' SHE SAID, BY WAY OFKEEPING UP THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE. `'tIS SO,' SAID THE dUCHESS: `AND THE MORAL OF THAT IS--"oH,'TIS LOVE, 'TIS LOVE, THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND!"' `sOMEBODY SAID,' aLICE WHISPERED, `THAT IT'S DONE BY EVERYBODYMINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS!' `aH, WELL! iT MEANS MUCH THE SAME THING,' SAID THE dUCHESS,DIGGING HER SHARP LITTLE CHIN INTO aLICE'S SHOULDER AS SHE ADDED,`AND THE MORAL OF that IS--"tAKE CARE OF THE SENSE, AND THESOUNDS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES."' `hOW FOND SHE IS OF FINDING MORALS IN THINGS!' aLICE THOUGHT TOHERSELF. `i DARE SAY YOU'RE WONDERING WHY i DON'T PUT MY ARM ROUND YOURWAIST,' THE dUCHESS SAID AFTER A PAUSE: `THE REASON IS, THAT i'MDOUBTFUL ABOUT THE TEMPER OF YOUR FLAMINGO. sHALL i TRY THEEXPERIMENT?' `he MIGHT BITE,' aLICE CAUTIOUSLY REPLIED, NOT FEELING AT ALLANXIOUS TO HAVE THE EXPERIMENT TRIED. `vERY TRUE,' SAID THE dUCHESS: `FLAMINGOES AND MUSTARD BOTHBITE. aND THE MORAL OF THAT IS--"bIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCKTOGETHER."' `oNLY MUSTARD ISN'T A BIRD,' aLICE REMARKED. `rIGHT, AS USUAL,' SAID THE dUCHESS: `WHAT A CLEAR WAY YOUHAVE OF PUTTING THINGS!' `iT'S A MINERAL, i think,' SAID aLICE. `oF COURSE IT IS,' SAID THE dUCHESS, WHO SEEMED READY TO AGREETO EVERYTHING THAT aLICE SAID; `THERE'S A LARGE MUSTARD-MINE NEARHERE. aND THE MORAL OF THAT IS--"tHE MORE THERE IS OF MINE, THELESS THERE IS OF YOURS."' `oH, i KNOW!' EXCLAIMED aLICE, WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED TO THISLAST REMARK, `IT'S A VEGETABLE. iT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE, BUT ITIS.' `i QUITE AGREE WITH YOU,' SAID THE dUCHESS; `AND THE MORAL OFTHAT IS--"bE WHAT YOU WOULD SEEM TO BE"--OR IF YOU'D LIKE IT PUTMORE SIMPLY--"nEVER IMAGINE YOURSELF NOT TO BE OTHERWISE THANWHAT IT MIGHT APPEAR TO OTHERS THAT WHAT YOU WERE OR MIGHT HAVEBEEN WAS NOT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT YOU HAD BEEN WOULD HAVE APPEAREDTO THEM TO BE OTHERWISE."' `i THINK i SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER,' aLICE SAID VERYPOLITELY, `IF i HAD IT WRITTEN DOWN: BUT i CAN'T QUITE FOLLOW ITAS YOU SAY IT.' `tHAT'S NOTHING TO WHAT i COULD SAY IF i CHOSE,' THE dUCHESSREPLIED, IN A PLEASED TONE. `pRAY DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TO SAY IT ANY LONGER THAN THAT,'SAID aLICE. `oH, DON'T TALK ABOUT TROUBLE!' SAID THE dUCHESS. `i MAKE YOUA PRESENT OF EVERYTHING i'VE SAID AS YET.' `a CHEAP SORT OF PRESENT!' THOUGHT aLICE. `i'M GLAD THEY DON'TGIVE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS LIKE THAT!' bUT SHE DID NOT VENTURE TOSAY IT OUT LOUD. `tHINKING AGAIN?' THE dUCHESS ASKED, WITH ANOTHER DIG OF HERSHARP LITTLE CHIN. `i'VE A RIGHT TO THINK,' SAID aLICE SHARPLY, FOR SHE WASBEGINNING TO FEEL A LITTLE WORRIED. `jUST ABOUT AS MUCH RIGHT,' SAID THE dUCHESS, `AS PIGS HAVE TOFLY; AND THE M--' bUT HERE, TO aLICE'S GREAT SURPRISE, THE dUCHESS'S VOICE DIEDAWAY, EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FAVOURITE WORD `MORAL,' AND THEARM THAT WAS LINKED INTO HERS BEGAN TO TREMBLE. aLICE LOOKED UP,AND THERE STOOD THE qUEEN IN FRONT OF THEM, WITH HER ARMS FOLDED,FROWNING LIKE A THUNDERSTORM. `a FINE DAY, YOUR mAJESTY!'
